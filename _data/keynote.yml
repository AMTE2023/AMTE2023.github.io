    Dr. Thomas Sterling is President and Chief Scientist of Simultac LLC. Since
    receiving his Ph.D from MIT in 1984 as a Hertz Fellow Dr. Sterling has engaged
    in applied research in fields associated with parallel computing system
    structures, semantics, and operation in industry, government labs, and
    academia. Dr. Sterling is best known as the "father of Beowulf" for his
    pioneering research in commodity/Linux cluster computing. He was awarded the
    Gordon Bell Prize in 1997 with his collaborators for this work. He was the PI
    of the HTMT Project sponsored by NSF, DARPA, NSA, and NASA to explore advanced
    technologies and their implication for high-end system architectures. Other
    research projects included the DARPA DIVA PIM architecture project with
    USC-ISI, the Cray Cascade Petaflops architecture project sponsored by the DARPA
    HPCS Program, and the Gilgamesh high-density computing project at NASA JPL. Dr.
    Sterling is the co-author of six books and holds six patents. He was the
    recipient of the 2013 Vanguard Award, and in 2014 he was named a fellow of the
    American Association for the Advancement of Science.
title: Active Memory Architecture for Many-Task Asynchronous Graph Supercomputing
abstract: |
    Now, as conventional practices preclude further advances of significance, HPC looks towards
    innovations in architecture, execution models, and programming methods to achieve orders of
    magnitude gains in efficiency, scalability, and productivity through this decade and beyond. The
    class of many-task asynchronous computing offers promising new directions at a time when the
    end of Moore's Law at nano-scale technology eliminates a previous means of exponential
    growth. This presentation introduces Active Memory Architecture (AMA), a memory-centric
    structure and non-von Neumann semantics for parallel execution of time-varying graph-based
    applications. The wide range of applicable domains include: numeric-intensive problems such
    as AMR, PIC, and N-body, as well as symbolic-computations for data analytics, machine learning,
    decision making, and machine understanding. AMA is a leap forward in parallel computer
    architecture. It is based on the ParalleX execution model, an advanced many-task
    asynchronous paradigm exploiting runtime information for resource management and task
    scheduling and replacing the legacy von Neumann architecture with memory-centric structures.
    Memory latency and memory bandwidth are prioritized rather than FPU utilization. The IARPA
    AGILE research program is sponsoring the design and analysis of AMA to determine its viability
    and competitiveness with respect to more conventional strategies. Early analysis suggests that
    an AMA exascale system with contemporary technologies is achievable in less than 1/10 th the
    footprint of legacy-derivative computers. Questions by the audience is encouraged throughout
    the presentation.
