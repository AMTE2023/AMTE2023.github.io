 title: Active Memory Architecture for Many-Task Asynchronous Graph Supercomputing
 abstract: |
    Now, as conventional practices preclude further advances of significance, HPC looks towards
    innovations in architecture, execution models, and programming methods to achieve orders of
    magnitude gains in efficiency, scalability, and productivity through this decade and beyond. The
    class of many-task asynchronous computing offers promising new directions at a time when the
    end of Moore's Law at nano-scale technology eliminates a previous means of exponential
    growth. This presentation introduces Active Memory Architecture (AMA), a memory-centric
    structure and non-von Neumann semantics for parallel execution of time-varying graph-based
    applications. The wide range of applicable domains include: numeric-intensive problems such
    as AMR, PIC, and N-body, as well as symbolic-computations for data analytics, machine learning,
    decision making, and machine understanding. AMA is a leap forward in parallel computer
    architecture. It is based on the ParalleX execution model, an advanced many-task
    asynchronous paradigm exploiting runtime information for resource management and task
    scheduling and replacing the legacy von Neumann architecture with memory-centric structures.
    Memory latency and memory bandwidth are prioritized rather than FPU utilization. The IARPA
    AGILE research program is sponsoring the design and analysis of AMA to determine its viability
    and competitiveness with respect to more conventional strategies. Early analysis suggests that
    an AMA exascale system with contemporary technologies is achievable in less than 1/10 th the
    footprint of legacy-derivative computers. Questions by the audience is encouraged throughout
    the presentation.
